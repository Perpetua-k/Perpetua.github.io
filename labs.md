###  Network Scanning â€“ Nmap & Nessus
**Problem:** Identify vulnerabilities on lab environment by combining network discovery and vulnerability scanning techniques..  
**Approach:** Used Nmap for recon, Nessus for vulnerability validation. 
**Reconnaissance (Nmap)** â€” Performed host discovery and service enumeration using:
   ```bash
   nmap -sS -sV -O -p- -T4 <target-range>
**Tools:** Nmap, Nessus.  

Delivered live demo using Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark.
